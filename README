Overall Approach:

Since every request we send has a constant header, we first put together a header that we could use for all our requests.
Once we had the header, we formulated our question. We measured the length the the QNAME would occupy, allocated appropriate
space, and then tokenized the name from the arguments and wrote it into our response packet, followed by appropriate values
for QTYPE and QCLASS before sending to the server. Although our header is theoretically constant, we did split it into several
variables for readability and to allow changes to be made easily if needed.
