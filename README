Overall Approach:

Since every request we send has a constant header, we first put together a 
header that we could use for all our requests. Once we had the header, we 
formulated our question. We measured the length the the QNAME would occupy, 
allocated appropriate space, and then tokenized the name from the arguments 
and wrote it into our response packet, followed by appropriate values for 
QTYPE and QCLASS before sending to the server. Although our header is 
theoretically constant, we did split it into several variables for readability 
and to allow changes to be made easily if needed.

Testing
---
We used used the gdb debugger as well as good old-fashioned print statements 
to debug how our DNS requests and responses were being sent and interpreted.

Challenges
---
We had a few problems getting the responses to be read correctly. A main 
problem was also in the DNS Packet Compression, which proved to be the 
source of many bugs. The most time consuming part was probably the parsing 
of the name fields on the responses and requests.
